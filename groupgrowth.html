      <p> When ATEEZ returned to America for the first time since 2019, the breakout K-pop group wasn’t as much amazed by upgrading from 800-person-capacity clubs to sold-out arenas as they were with finally reuniting with the actual people in the audience.While the face time was thrilling, so was playing for the biggest crowds of their career. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, five of the reported six U.S. stops in ATEEZ’s 2022 The Fellowship: Beginning of the End tour sold 43,500 tickets and grossed $4.6 million. That included a $1.1 million gross at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., for their Jan. 24 show, and $2.2 million at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., for Jan. 30-31. These numbers mark one of the fastest rises for K-pop artists in Billboard Boxscore history.
